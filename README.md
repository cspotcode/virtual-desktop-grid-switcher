This is a fork of VirtualDesktopGridSwitcher that allows more flexibility and customization of hotkeys.  You can trigger the hotkeys via an AutoHotKey script, which allows
unlimited custom hotkeys, overriding built-in Windows shortcuts, or any other advanced logic you can think of.

## Quick-start:

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cspotcode/virtual-desktop-grid-switcher/releases/) and unzip it somewhere.  Install AutoHotkey.  Run `autohotkey/virtual-desktop-hotkeys.ahk`.  That's it!

## Hotkeys:

The included AutoHotKey script is configured with the following hotkeys.  They can all be customized by modifying the `.ahk` script.

* Ctrl+Win+&lt;arrow key>: Switch desktop
* Win+Alt+&lt;arrow key>: Move active window and switch desktop
* Ctrl+Win+A: Toggle always-on-top for active window
* Ctrl+Win+S: Toggle sticky for active window

*Hotkeys for switching to a specific desktop aren't supported at the moment.  If you want that feature, send me a message.*
